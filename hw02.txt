When describing ways in which an ENTP's learning is hindered, it solidified the points I made in hw01 about the learning styles I prefer. An ENTP's learning is hindered when "Material is trivial." This is exactly what the 1114 tests and exams were. On the other hand, the 1114 homeworks and projects were perfect for my learning.
All other descriptions of ENTP were pretty accurate, but that one sentence is what hits home for me right now because of the methods and practices of the educational system.

"Inventor". Enthusiastic interest in everything and always sensitive to possibilities. Non-conformist and innovative. 3.2% of the total population.
I wasn't a big fan of their list of famous ENTP's. It was pretty boring and not motivating. I was hoping to see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) because he's one of my role models. I watch a lot of anime too, so I have role models that are anime characters. Radical Edward is probably my biggest anime role model.
